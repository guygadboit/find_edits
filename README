This looks in a set of aligned sequences for any patterns 6nt long that look
like they might have been edited in the first one.

It just looks at each time each pattern appears in any of them and ranks them
by the average number of differences.

Run it like this:

$ python3 find_edits.py | tee output
$ sort -rn -k2 output > sorted-output

And then look for any interesting sequences at the top of sorted-output.

The output has been included. sorted-output2 is using the current scoring
algorithm (ignore sorted-output, or look in the git history to see what it does
if you're interested).

input.fasta contains the aligned sequences. input.clu is the same thing but in
a format I find more readable. Those were generated like this:

$ cat WH1.fasta RpYN06.fasta BANAL52.fasta BANAL116.fasta RaTG13.fasta | clustalo -i - > input.fasta

$ cat WH1.fasta RpYN06.fasta BANAL52.fasta BANAL116.fasta RaTG13.fasta | clustalo -i - --outfmt=clu --resno -o input.clu

graph.png is the numbers in sorted-output2 put on a graph with a few
interesting sequences marked near where they appear.
